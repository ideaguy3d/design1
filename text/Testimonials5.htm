					I wanted to take this opportunity to say thanks again for the order I received before Christmas. You were very patient with me even though I rang a couple of times to make sure my order was sent next day delivery. There are a few different companies selling Aussie products as I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware - even a few closer to me and I reckon you should take it as a good indication that you&#39;re doing a great job if I live accross the country and would rather order from Aussie Products Co. than anywhere else!&quot;<br />

					I just wanted to take the quick opportunity to thank you for sending me my lollies and biscuits that I have only been able to enjoy every few years since moving over here to the US. As soon as the box arrived, I ripped it open and started demolishing the lollies and washed it all down with a nice tall glass of cordial. My uncle actually lives down in San Jose so I will be sure to come by and pick up my next supplies directly from you in the near future.<br />
					Cheers again!&quot;<br />

When our friends see these, they will want a set too. Just cannot understand why we don&#39;t sell them in the U.K. Well thanks again for your great service.&quot;<br />

The kids loved them and were asking for more. What a simple meal for dinner or snack. They were very convenient and allowed the kids to eat something healthy that tastes great at the same time. My husband and I loved them too. They were a mother&#39;s dream. Thanks so much!&quot;<br />

					<span style="font-size: 14px"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Just thought I would write and let you know how much I love your meat pies. They are truly delicious. I am an Aussie from Melbourne and would never eat meat pies in Australia unless they were homemade because my mother said the content was &#39;suspicious&#39; (i.e. they contained dead flies or whatever - yuk) but I have been enjoying your pies almost since the time I came to California in 1989. I also enjoy all your other products - particularly love the Kraft Cheddar Cheese and the diet lemon cordial, as well as the Clinkers and musk sticks. I am not going to turn this into a never-ending e-mail; just wanted to let you know how much I enjoy the pies and your other products. Your service is also excellent, and I thank you.&quot;<br />

We&#39;ve formed an aussie group over here in Birmingham, Alabama, and get together for all Oz holidays and just for the hell of it. We&#39;re all married to Americans so US holidays are also a good excuse for a get-together. It&#39;s our turn to host at the end of August (pool party and barbie) so the Oz napkins I purchased were a must! Thank you for the quick shipping and the great aussie products!&quot;<br />
