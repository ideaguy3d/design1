						<br><p>Dear Friends,</p>
						<p>We have all felt the impact over the past couple years of the current economic downturn. Some of us have been hit harder than others. We at Australian Products Co have noticed recently that some of the local families here in the Bay Area have really had a pressing need for assistance.</p>
						<p>You, our circle of friends, many of whom have supported our business during the past twenty years, are an amazing group of people. Whenever you have been called upon to help out, you’ve risen to the occasion with open hands and full hearts. Wherever there has been a need in the world, many of you have stepped up and offered a hand. You have all made a difference in the world.</p>
						<p>It is in that same spirit of helping that we ask you to help these local families in need. Anyone who brings non-perishable food items to our store will receive a complimentary package of Original Tim Tams as our way to say thank you. We plan to continue this food drive through each month this year.</p>
						<p>You can bring items into the store all month long, as we’ll be packaging and distributing your donations at the end of each month, but if you bring in items on the last Saturday of each month, we will have some extra special treats out to show our gratitude.</p>
						<p>If you are not in the Bay Area but still wish to help these families in need, you may purchase and send a gift card for a large grocery chain (Lucky, Safeway, Wal-Mart, Target, etc.). Please do not send cash or cheques. What these families need most right now is food and groceries.</p>
						<p>As March marks the first month that we’re holding this food drive, we really need your full support in this endeavour so that we can provide these families with a little extra to get them back on their feet.</p>
						<p>You may drop off donations at our store (3680 Stevens Creek Blvd, San Jose, CA 95117) Monday through Saturday from 10am to 6pm. If you have any questions, call us at 1-888-422-9259 or email us at <a href="mailto:aussieproducts@sbcglobal.net?subject=Food Drive">aussieproducts@sbcglobal.net</a>.</p>
						<p>Thank you.</p>
